I’m a master student in Bioinformatics at Northeastern University. I earned my bachelor degree in NEU as well, majoring in computer science with a biology minor. I’m broadly interested in computational biology, especially perturbation modeling in epigenomics. 

I used to work at the gnomAD team and Seqr team of Broad Institute and at the Devsci department of Genentech. I’m currently advised by Professor [Predrag Radivojac](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/radivojac/) at Northeastern University.

I was borned and stayed in Fuzhou until 10th grade. I finished my high school in Beverly Hills and am spending my college years in Boston.
